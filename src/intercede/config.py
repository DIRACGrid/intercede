"""Backend configuration: how a consumer says which backend it wants.

There is one model per kind of backend, and ``BackendConfig`` is any of them,
chosen by ``kind`` (and, for ``batch``, by ``transport``). Each model has
exactly the fields of its backend, so a field that does not apply is refused
when the configuration is read, not ignored or discovered at the first submit.

A consumer can build a model directly, or pass the same data as a mapping, such
as a parsed TOML table, to ``validate_config`` or ``registry.get_backend``::

    kind = "batch"
    transport = "ssh"
    scheduler = "slurm"
    host = "batch.example.org"
    user = "dirac"
    known_hosts = "batch.example.org ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."

Configuration describes the resource and is never secret: keys, passwords,
and tokens come from the credential provider at run time. Error
messages therefore never repeat the values they were given. The kinds are a
closed set: they list what interCEde ships.
